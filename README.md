# powertentacle
tentacles from the ceiling providing electricity. better than stumbling over ground cables.

## planning
I developed a python script to get all the dimensions in 2D space right

from these 2D dimensions I made a 3D object. Each segment is 94% the size of the previous segment. And because the left face of the trapezoid is exactly 94% the size of the right one, the segments fit perfectly together in series.

## 3d printing & assembly

printed wth regular PLA, the segments are conneted with cable ties and the tendon is a nylon cord.
